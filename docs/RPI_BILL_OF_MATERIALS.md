# Raspberry Pi Deployment Bill of Materials

This list covers the basic hardware required to run `relay.py` on a Raspberry Pi. Adjust quantities according to your cluster size.

## Recommended Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi 5** (4GB or 8GB RAM)
- **64GB or larger microSD card** (for Raspberry Pi OS and Docker images)
- **USB‑C power supply** capable of 5V/5A
- **Ethernet cable** for reliable network connectivity
- **Cooling solution** such as a case with a fan or a heatsink
- **Optional: PoE+ HAT** and PoE-capable switch if you want to power the Pi over Ethernet
- **Optional: USB SSD** for better storage performance
- **Cloudflare account** with a registered domain for tunneling

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the Pi as described in the runbook. This bill of materials is a starting point—feel free to adapt it to your setup.
