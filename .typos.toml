# .typos.toml ── flywheel spell‑check configuration
# -------------------------------------------------
# This version:
#   • Skips minified JS and other generated artefacts
#   • Treats commit SHAs and short project tokens as valid
#   • Keeps your previous word allow‑list untouched
#
# Notes on structure:
#   * Keys under [default] configure *behaviour*.
#   * The [default.extend-words] table enumerates additional valid words.
#   * The [files] table extends the file‑selection globs.

[default]
# Ignore any 7‑ to 40‑char hexadecimal sequence (Git commit hashes, object IDs, etc.)
