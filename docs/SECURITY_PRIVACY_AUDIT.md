# Security and Privacy Audit Log

This log records security and privacy audits performed on `token.place`.
Each entry includes the date of the audit, the Git commit hash that was
reviewed, and a summary of improvements or outstanding issues. Future audits
should append a new entry following the template below.

## Audit History

### [2025-03-28] - commit 62eb77c2f0b0daf73767e2e66d901a8358024ebb

**Summary**
Initial audit establishing baseline security and privacy posture.

**Completed Improvements**
- Implemented environment-aware logging that only logs during development/testing.
- Added `ENVIRONMENT` checks throughout the codebase to prevent logging in production.
- Created helper functions (`log_info`, `log_warning`, `log_error`) that automatically respect the environment setting.
- Replaced all direct print/logger calls with environment-aware versions.
- Added a null handler for production environments to suppress all logs.
- Fixed port configuration to use consistent testing ports (5010 for relay, 5020 for server).
- Verified correct implementation of the RSAâ€“AES hybrid encryption scheme.
- Ensured proper handling of encryption keys and secure transmission.
- Improved test reliability by explicitly passing mock LLM flags and fixing encoding issues.

**Recommendations**
- Implement content safety measures to prevent misuse of the system.
- Add rate limiting to protect against DoS attacks.
- Move sensitive configuration values to environment variables.
- Enhance input validation for all API endpoints.
- Plan for streaming implementation, key rotation, and a dedicated cryptographic audit.
- Consider zero-knowledge architecture, formal verification, and an external security review.

**Privacy Enhancements**
- No production logging.
- Minimized data storage; conversation data is not persisted.
- Encryption and decryption occur client-side.
- No analytics or usage tracking.

**Security Testing**
- Unit tests cover core cryptographic functions.
- Integration tests verify that components work together securely.
- End-to-end tests confirm encryption throughout the workflow.

**Compliance Considerations**
- GDPR readiness through minimal data collection.
- CCPA compatibility for the same reason.
- Foundation for HIPAA compliance via end-to-end encryption.

### [2025-06-17] - commit 33bd9ef8546b6e9331c4d72ff056a2c528f8de7f

**Summary**
Project structure reorganization and documentation updates.

**Completed Improvements**
- Moved configuration files into `config/` for clarity.
- Updated test references to reflect new paths.

**Recommendations**
- Continue to monitor for broken links or outdated paths after large refactors.
