# API v1-only E2EE relay architecture (v0.1.0)

This note is the canonical architecture baseline for the API v1 E2EE migration roadmap.

## Release target and scope

- **API v1 is the active API for token.place v0.1.0.**
- **API v1 is non-streaming.** Responses are returned only after full model generation is
  complete.
- **Do not add streaming to API v1** for relay/client-server inference paths.
- **API v1 chat is text-only.** The v0.1.0 runtime target is a single Llama 3-family text
  model, not a multimodal model. Chat completion payloads must not accept, transform, summarize,
  placeholder, or otherwise pretend to support image content blocks such as `image_url`,
  `input_image`, or `image`; these requests must fail closed at validation/runtime boundaries.

## Runtime routing rules (must-follow)

All active production inference paths must use API v1 E2EE routes:

- `server.py` API/runtime inference paths
- `relay.py` relay paths
- `client.py` client paths
- `desktop-tauri` compute-node / bridge paths
- relay landing-page HTML chat UI served by `relay.py`

If a path cannot preserve API v1 E2EE invariants, it must **fail closed** instead of routing
plaintext or using deprecated fallbacks.

### Desktop runtime completion contract

API v1 desktop bridge generation must use the direct OpenAI-compatible runtime completion API:
`get_llm_instance().create_chat_completion(..., stream=False)`. This direct non-streaming
completion path is required even when the client sends `options: {}` or explicitly sends
`options: {"stream": false}`.

A desktop runtime that only exposes legacy chat-history helpers such as
`llama_cpp_get_response()` is **not** API v1-capable for relay inference. API v1 relay handling
must return an encrypted fail-closed error, such as `compute_node_model_unsupported`, rather
than silently falling back to legacy runtime behavior. Do not preserve, add, or suggest a legacy
runtime fallback for API v1 desktop relay requests.

## API v2 status

- API v2 exists in the repository, but it is currently incomplete.
- Do **not** route active runtime traffic through API v2 yet.
- Do **not** migrate server, relay, client, desktop, or relay HTML chat UI runtime paths to API v2
  until API v1 is launched and v0.1.0 is finalized.

## Deprecated legacy relay endpoints

The following endpoints are deprecated legacy relay routes:

- `/sink`
- `/faucet`
- `/source`
- `/retrieve`
- `/next_server`

Rules:

- Do not use them in active production inference paths.
- Do not extend them for new features.
- Do not reintroduce them as compatibility fallbacks in active runtime traffic.
- Use API v1 E2EE relay routes instead.

Legacy routes may remain temporarily for historical compatibility and migration staging, but they
must be clearly labeled deprecated legacy behavior in docs and code comments.

## E2EE invariant (relay-blind requirement)

Relay-visible surfaces must remain ciphertext-only plus safe routing metadata.

Relay-owned state, relay logs, relay diagnostics, and relay HTTP payloads must never include
plaintext model payload content, including:

- plaintext prompts
- OpenAI `messages`
- legacy `prompt` fields
- assistant response text
- tool arguments
- model output text or equivalent content payloads

Any path that would expose plaintext to relay-owned surfaces must fail closed.

## Migration context (why this exists)

There is a known alignment gap between `relay.py`, desktop-tauri flows, and the relay landing-page
HTML chat UI. Some end-to-end flow segments still hit deprecated legacy routes.

The migration roadmap follow-up phases own the implementation repair:

1. restore/audit API v1 relay/server route contract,
2. migrate desktop bridge paths,
3. migrate relay landing-page chat path and remove plaintext bypass behavior,
4. add final guardrails proving active production paths no longer use legacy routes.

This documentation baseline intentionally does **not** implement those code migrations.

## Manual staging verification: desktop compute-node registration + long-poll heartbeat

Use this when validating a desktop compute node against `https://staging.token.place`:

1. Launch the desktop compute node with API v1 relay mode pointed at staging.
2. Confirm relay health is green:
   - `GET https://staging.token.place/healthz`
   - verify `knownServers >= 1`.
3. Confirm relay diagnostics sees the registered node:
   - `GET https://staging.token.place/relay/diagnostics`
   - verify the compute node public key appears in registered node diagnostics.
4. Let the node idle with no queued requests for several poll intervals.
   - expected behavior: repeated API v1 `No requests available` heartbeat responses,
     no sustained registration churn, and no repeated desktop read-timeout storms.
