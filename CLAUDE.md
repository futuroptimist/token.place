# Claude Integration

This file summarizes best practices from [Anthropic's "Claude Code Best Practices"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices).
It complements [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [llms.txt](llms.txt) by focusing on guidance specific to the Claude model family.

## Key Points
- Keep prompts concise and provide explicit context.
- Prefer deterministic functions with clear input and output formats.
- Use code comments to explain non-obvious logic.
- Validate model output before acting on it.

For broader assistant behavior, see [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md).
