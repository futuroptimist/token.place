# CLAUDE

Guidelines for Anthropic's Claude assistant when helping with **token.place**.

- Prefer explicit IPv4 addresses like `127.0.0.1` in examples.
- On Windows use semicolons (`;`) for command chaining instead of `&&`.
- Keep replies concise and link to docs where possible.
- Reference [docs/LLM_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md](docs/LLM_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md) for detailed tips.
